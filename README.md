## Background

The main objective for this app is to create a peer to peer platform for user to sing karaoke with friends or other users. User can communicate through audio and sending message. User can also upload songs to the platform so that they can sing with the music behind. We hope that this app can provide the same experience as a real karaoke room. Please enjoy!

## For User

You can also join a room by pressing "join room" with a valid room ID from another user.

- Straming room is for user to share/enjoy the singing of other unknown users.
- Private room is for user to sing and chat privately with friends

## For Developer

First and foremost, get npm package manager in your OS.

Then, enter this directory and run the installation of npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
