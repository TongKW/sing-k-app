This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Background

The main objective for this app is to create a peer to peer platform for user to sing karaoke with friends or other users. User can communicate through audio and sending message. User can also upload songs to the platform so that they can sing with the music behind. We hope that this app can provide the same experience as a real karaoke room. Please enjoy!

## For User

Please access to the latest version of the app through [https://sing-k-app.vercel.app/](https://sing-k-app.vercel.app/)

First, create an account using a valid email address. An email verification will be sent a few seconds after.

Then, Login to the app using your own username and password created.

Next, you can create a streaming room or a private room by pressing the corresponding button.

You can also join a room by pressing "join room" with a valid room ID from another user.

- Straming room is for user to share/enjoy the singing of other unknown users.
- Private room is for user to sing and chat privately with friends

Other than that, username and avatar can be set under "User Profile". Password can be changed under "Change Password"

## For Developer

First and foremost, get npm package manager in your OS.

Then, enter this directory and run the installation of npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
